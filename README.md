# Pour Lab

A minimalistic React app designed to help coffee enthusiasts determine optimal brewing techniques. The app calculates custom pour schedules based on coffee variety, drying process, brewing method, grams of coffee, and water to ground coffee ratio. Deployed on GitHub Pages for easy access.

Disclaimer! This app was developed for my own personal enjoyment :: 
The goal is to learn React and create a useful tool for myself.
